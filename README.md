A robust and user-friendly application that provides **real-time flight information** by integrating with the [AeroDataBox API](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox). Designed for high reliability, the system includes a **fallback mechanism** that uses a mock database when API requests fail, ensuring consistent availability of flight data.
